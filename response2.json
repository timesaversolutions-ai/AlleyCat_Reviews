  "text": "We're going to review a park in the state of New York. The city is Bayside, which is a town in Queens. The facility is Crocheron Park, run by the New York City Parks Department. The facility has permanent lines and permanent nets. There is a paddle rack queue. There are six courts. They have ability-based playing system for beginner, intermediate, and advanced players. Additional comments here is they do not have lights. They do not have windscreens. There are no wind flags, and there are no dividers east-west between the courts, only north-south dividers. They have restrooms. There's a water fountain. There is plenty seating in the shade. They have trash receptacles, ball recycling. There is parking, and partially parking can be seen from the courts. They do not have a bike rack and no ambassador contact at this time."
